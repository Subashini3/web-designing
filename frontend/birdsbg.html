    <h2>BIRDS<h2>
        <p><h3>Pet parrots can be incredible if demanding friends, but for people more accustomed 
            to fluffy mammalian companions, they can present some unexpected challenges. 
            The long-lived, intelligent and highly social birds need especially high amounts 
            of attention and enrichment, or else they can pick up bad habits and find
            While some pet parrots come from breeders, trade in exotic parrots is big business around the globe, and it contributes significantly to their decline in the wild. Thankfully trafficking in wild birds has been less of a problem in the U.S. since the passage of the 1992 Wild Bird Conservation Act and CITES restrictions on importing exotic species.

            Now, in honor of the 14th annual National Bird Day, get a little bird-brained with these 14 facts 
            about parrots:
           <h2> Some Parrots Grind Their Own Calcium Supplements:</h2>

As a famous research subject, the African grey parrot Alex 
was said to have the intelligence of a human 5-year-old. Now the psittacine tribe can 
claim another brainy feat: tool use. Researchers at the University of York and the University of
 St. Andrews observed captive greater vasa parrots (Coracopsis vasa) using date pits and pebbles to 
 pulverize cockle shells. Male vasas ate the powder and then offered a regurgitated calcium-rich snack
  to females before mating. Be thankful you get chocolates.
 <h2> Parrot Toes Are Zygodactyl</h2>

Like most other birds, parrots have four toes per foot. But instead of the usual 
three-in-front-one-behind arrangement, parrot toes are configured for maximum grip:
 two in front and two behind, like two pairs of opposable thumbs. Combined with beaks
  that can crack even the world’s toughest nuts, their unique feet make them formidable eaters,
   not to mention dexterous climbers.

<h2>Polly Wants Mutton</h2>

Many parrots are omnivores and will eat pretty much anything—fruit, seeds, nuts,
 insects and even meat. Some species, like the rainbow-colored lories and lorikeets of 
 the South Pacific, feed almost exclusively on nectar with brush-tipped tongues, though recently
  even these birds were seen eating meat at feeding stations in Australia. In New Zealand, native kea (Nestor species) were first observed attacking and killing sheep in 1868 and were persecuted as sheep-killers until 1986, when they were granted protected status.
  <h2>Not All Parrots Are Tropical</h2>

  Of the roughly 350 known species of parrots, most live in the tropical and subtropical regions of Australia,
   Asia, Central and South America and Africa. But some parrots break that geographic mold. Keas live in alpine regions of New Zealand and nest in ground burrows, while the endangered maroon-fronted parrot 
  (Rhynchopsitta terrisi) dwells at 6,000 feet in the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains of Mexico. 
  <h2>Parrots Usually Match Their Mates</h2>

  With a couple of notable exceptions, males and females of most parrot species look virtually
   identical. It takes a keen eye—and usually a lab test—to tell a boy bird from a girl bird. 
   But some species, like the Solomon Island eclectus (Eclectus roratus), are so different that for many 
   years people thought they were distinct species of birds. Males are bright emerald green with flame-colored
    beaks, while females top off their crimson and royal blue ensembles with black beaks and a bright scarlet
     head.
  
  <h2> Parrots Taste With the Tops of Their Beaks</h2>
  
  Though parrots do have some taste glands at the backs of their throats, 
  most of their 300 or so taste buds are located on the roofs of their mouths. 
  Compared with the 10,000 taste buds in a human mouth, the birds' palate may not seem like much,
   but parrots do show definite preferences for certain foods.</h3>
